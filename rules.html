                    One person from Team 1 will start. When the first dare appears on the screen, the player may choose to play or pass. 
                </li>
                    <br/>
                <li>
                    If you choose to play, you must complete the dare or NO points will be awarded. If you choose to pass your dare off to another team, the potential points for completing the dare will be doubled.
                </li>
                    <br/>
                <li>
                    If a dare's completion is based on time, points awarded for time will be rounded down to the nearest minute. (ex: 3 minutes and 48 seconds = 3 points)

                <li>
                    The team with the most points at the end wins! More than one team may win if there is a tie.
